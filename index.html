    <h2 class="About Me">About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Stacy Reynolds. By day, I work as an accountant, but I have always had a creative side that I love
    exploring. I am new to coding and graphic design, but  I;m excitrd to be learning and building my skills every day. Right now I'm focused on HTML,
    CSS, and design basics, and this portfolio is where I am sharing the projects I've created along the way</p>
    <p>What I enjoy most about design and coding is the change to mix creativity with problem solving. Even as a beginner, I've
    found that every project teaches me something new and gives me the motivation to keep going.</p>
    <p>Outside of learning and creating, I love hiking and making homwmade perfumes and bath scrubs. These hobbies, much 
    like coding and design, let me explore creativity in different ways.</p>
    <p>I'm looking forward to growing my skills, taking on new challenges, and continuing this journey into the world of design.</p>
